Project Description:

We propose a system which combines internet of things (IoT) based sensing of environmental parameters and image processing to monitor the health of plants along with detecting any diseases associated with it. We are using NodeMCU based IoT device which sends real-time sensor data like air temperature, humidity, soil moisture to the cloud. Image of the affected part of plant is captured and compared to the images in the dataset, wherein using deep learning models the disease is identified. Once a disease is identified, our system will suggest chemicals that are to be used to eradicate the disease.

This Project Contains:

- App Source Code
- Deep Learning Code for Disease Detection
- Aurdino Code for NodeMCU and Sensors

In order to run the App the following steps have to be made:

* Download the Source code and install Andriod Studio
* Install Dart SDK in the System
* Install Flutter and Dart plugin in Android Studio
* Import the project
* Run the project and the result will be displayed in a Emulator or in a Android phone which is in Debugging Mode.
